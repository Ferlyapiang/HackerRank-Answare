# Task
# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,  a and b . Add code to print three lines where:

# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
# Example
# a = 3
# b=5

# Print the following:

# 8
# -2
# 15
# Input Format

# The first line contains the first integer, a.
# The second line contains the second integer, b.

# Constraints
# 1 <= a <= 10 10
# 1 <= b <= 10 10


# Output Format

# Print the three lines as explained above.

# Sample Input 0

# 3
# 2
# Sample Output 0

# 5
# 1
# 6
# Explanation 0
# 3 + 2 = 5
# 3 - 2 = 1
# 3 * 2 = 6
